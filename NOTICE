XZALGOCHAIN - HIGH-PERFORMANCE CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTION
========================================================================

THIS IS STILL AN EARLY VERSION, NOT MEANT TO BE USED FOR ANY CRITICAL PURPOSE!!
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

XzalgoChain is a 320-bit cryptographic hash function designed for high 
performance across multiple platforms. Key features include:

- 320-bit (40-byte) hash output providing 160 bits of collision resistance
- Optimized SIMD implementations for x86/x64 (AVX2) and ARM (NEON) architectures
- Automatic CPU feature detection with graceful fallback to scalar implementation
- OpenMP support for parallel processing on multi-core systems
- Cross-platform compatibility: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS
- Thread-safe design with atomic operations for global settings
- Single-file header implementation for easy integration
- Apache 2.0 licensed for maximum flexibility

The algorithm combines ARX (Add-Rotate-XOR) operations, gamma mixing functions,
sigma transforms, and multiple rounds of "Little Box" and "Big Box" processing
to achieve strong cryptographic properties including:

- High avalanche effect (changing one input bit flips ~90% in ASCII and ~50% of 1 bit of output bits)
- Resistance to length extension attacks
- Strong diffusion and confusion properties
- Resistance to known cryptanalytic attacks
